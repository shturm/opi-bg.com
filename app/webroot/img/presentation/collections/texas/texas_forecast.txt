TEXAS COLLECTION BY OPI

Here are the shades that urban cowgirls and city slickers must have to make a fashion statement right now - the sunniest peaches and corals (Big Hair... Big Nails, Guy Meets Gal-veston); vivid orange and honeysuckle (Ya'll Come Back Ya Hear?, Too Hot Pink to Hold 'Em); beautiful berries (Do You Think I'm Tex-y?, Houston We Have a Purple); rich neutrals (San Tan-tonio, Suzi Loves Cowboys), and bodacious blue, green, and lavender (Austin-tatious Turquoise, I Vant to Be A-lone Star, Don't Mess with OPI, It's Totally Fort Worth It).

The Texas Collection by OPI was seen on models at the hottest spring shows, providing nails to be the on-trend accessory for stylistas - and OPI to be the designers' runway darling. Also spotted at the shows: essential white as the new black. Brightly colored botanical prints and lush florals. Relaxed trousers  and jackets; fuller, longer skirts and filmly scarves; and beautifully simple lines in shades of white, ivory, cream, and taupe. 

This spring and summer, try a lightened-up, brightened-up kind of pretty. The Texas Collection by OPI.
